		<h5>About Me</h5>

		
		
		<p>In my free time, I code in <b>Python 3</b> (in the repo '<a href="https://github.com/William-Banquier/WilliamBanquierPersonal" target="_blank">WilliamBanquierPersonal</a>' I have many magnificent <b>Machine Learning</b> projects where I use <b>Massive Data Sets</b> - in the <a href="https://github.com/William-Banquier/WilliamBanquierPersonal/tree/master/Random%20Machine%20Learning/KickStarterData" target="_blank">Kickstarter Machine Learning Code Project</a> (this is a .ibnpy) there are <b>378,662</b> rows in the dataset! (There are actually two .csv files inside the project folder, but since I only use one file, I am only counting the one file that I use)), I also like to do <b>LeetCode Coding Problems</b>. Don't worry, I also know and have multiple years of experience in <b>C#</b> (mostly on <b>Game Development</b>), <b>HTML</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, <b>CSS</b>, and also minor experience in <b>SQL</b>!</p>
		
		<p>I also have a <a href="https://github.com/William-Banquier" target="_blank">GitHub</a> account — please look around! </p>
		
		<p>Aside from coding, I have a love for <b>Robotics</b> (I have been part of the robotics club at my school for the past 4 years), <b>Taekwondo</b> (I am a second dan blackbelt), playing my <b>French Horn</b> (I have been playing my french horn for a bit over 5 years), and <b>Hiking</b> (I love taking a break and going on a long walk)!</p>
		
		<p><b>Please</b> contact me at "<a href="mailto:William.Banquier@gmail.com" target="new">William.Banquier@gmail.com</a>"!</p>

			//Get newest push from master in GitHub @William-Banquier/WilliamBanquierPersonal
			
			/*
			Code works by:
				1) Using the fetch command to get a JSON file with the required information using the GitHub API, we call our JSON variable "formatedResponce".
				
				2) To get our message variable (the one storing the commit), we can go to the child of our "formatedResponce" called commit, then go to the child of that, called commit… then we can get the value of "message" to find our commit message!
				
				3) For step three, we can follow the same method as we did in the second step to find the author's value. The only difference is instead of going to the "message" value we go to the sibling "author" value then we go to its child called name to get the name of our author.
				
				4) To get the date value, we start by following the steps of step 3, but instead of getting the name value, find the sibling (to the author value) date value.
				
				5) The date value is in the incorrect format—it is in 'ISO 8601', whereas we need it in 'RFC 2822'. Thankfully all that we need to do is turn our date variable (which is currently a string) into a JavaScript Date variable. Changing the type will automatically convert the date!
				
				6) Now, we can combine all these values into a nice string to output!
